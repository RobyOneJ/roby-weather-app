# roby-weather-app
This app processes csv files containing data about the weather and converts them into meaningful text-based summaries.

## Work details:
Needed to write functions to manipuate/convert/calculate data from existing files and, return the data in a readable format.
My approach was to work on a function at the time, run the related test to make sure my code was successful or debug the error, and, once passing, committing the change and so on until all the tests passed - see below screenshot.
